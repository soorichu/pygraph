This is really really Simple Python Graphing Program
It is arranged 3 tabs

1. first tab can draw 2d graphing such as y = x^2 and x = cos(t), y = sin(t)
2. second tab can draw 3d graphing such as z = sin(sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) and x = cos(u), y = cos(v), z = sin(u + v)
3. third tab can crawl rss feed datas and make word cloud map. it is so beautiful
