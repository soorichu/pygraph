This is really really Simple Python Graphing Program
It is arranged 3 tabs

1. first tab can draw 2d graphing such as y = x^2 and x = cos(t), y = sin(t)
2. second tab can draw 3d graphing such as z = sin(sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) and x = cos(u), y = cos(v), z = sin(u + v)
3. third tab can crawl rss feed datas and make word cloud map. it is so beautiful

This Program is made by SoooYoung Chung at 2018.8.16. in Incheon GongHang High School in Korea
This is follwed MIT License.
